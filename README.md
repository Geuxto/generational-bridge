links up crusty IRC old people and the strapping (?) young lads on d*scord

built on [mdbf](https://github.com/kurisufriend/modular-discord-bot-fw) and [ircked](https://github.com/kurisufriend/ircked)

put your token and path in `config.json`, point mbdf at it, and let 'er rip

(you also need to initialize the submodule, `git submodule init` then `git submodule update` should do the trick)
